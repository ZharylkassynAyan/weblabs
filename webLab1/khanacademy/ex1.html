        <h1>Oh Captain, my Captain</h1>
        <p>
            O Captain! My Captain! our fearful trip is done;<br>
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;<br>
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:<br>
    
          But O heart! heart! heart!<br>
                O the bleeding drops of red,[a]<br>
                      Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>
                            Fallen cold and dead.
        </p>
